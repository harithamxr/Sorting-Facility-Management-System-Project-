🏗️ Sorting Facility Management System (Java)
This project is a Java-based system developed for a sorting facility company to manage and streamline the process of sorting and organizing packages. The application utilizes multiple data structures such as queues, stacks, and linked lists to simulate and optimize real-world logistics operations including package intake, sorting, and dispatching.

🔧 Features:
Efficient package tracking and flow management

Real-time sorting simulation using core data structures

Clean, modular, and object-oriented design

Console-based interface for demonstration and testing

Developed during my internship, this project showcases the practical use of core data structures in building a logistics-oriented application.
